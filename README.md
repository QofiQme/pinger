# pinger
A ping tool that returns a pop up when destination is down

This tool would run continuous ping on a url/ip address and only return a pop up error message when the destination is down or cannot be reached. 
With the error pop up alert, you would know as soon as the IP/url is down. 
The pop up only would appear when the ping fails for 4 consecutive times.
